This is my first post about cryptography. Recently I learnt basics about [public key encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) and the [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) handshake. But the key exhange in the TLS handshake inspected by Wireshark, i.e. [ECDH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman)(Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman) troubled me for a while. This this the first time I knew [Elliptic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve). After some investigation, I'm recording those knowledges in case that I forget them. 

Note: in the following several posts, I would record more things I learnt about cryptography and its application in the computer network and Internet.

### First glance

A elliptic curve could be defined as:

$$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$

where 

$$4a^3 + 27b^2 \ne 0$$

Some examples of elliptic curves are like:

equation for red line is $$y^{2}=x^{3}+4x+4$$, equation for purple line is $$y^{2}=x^{3}-3x$$

### Group

Now lets review the [Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)) concept. 

A group $$G$$ is a set with a binary operation we define on the it, when 4 conditions are met. Usually we denote the operation as plus, then the 4 conditions are:

1. **Closure**: $$m + n$$ is always in $$G$$ as long as $$m$$ and $$n$$ in $$G$$.
2. **Associativity**: for all $$m$$, $$n$$ and $$r$$ in $$G$$, $$(m+n)+r = m+(n+r)$$.
3. **Identity element**: there is a element $$0$$ in $$G$$ such that $$m + 0 = 0 + m = m$$ for any $$m$$ in $$G$$.
4. **Inverse element**: for any $$m$$ in $$G$$, there is an element $$n$$ in $$G$$ such that $$m + n = 0$$, and we say $$n = -m$$

A group is a [Abelian group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_group) if the follwoing condition is also met:

**commutation**: for any $$m$$ and $$n$$ in $$G$$, there is $$m + n = n + m$$

Aparently the set of all real numbers $$R$$ could be an Abelian group with the arithmetic adding operation. 

### Define group on the elliptic curves

First, the set consists of all points in a elliptic curve. 

The Identity element $$0$$ would be a little special, it's defined as the infinitely far points of the curve.

Now, lets define the operation. For any points $$a$$ and $$b$$ in the curve:

1. if $$m = n$$ and $$y_m = 0$$, then $$m + n =0$$
2. if $$m = n$$ and $$y_m \ne 0$$, then $$m + n$$ is the other intersection of the curve and the line tangent to the curve in $$m$$.
3. if $$m \ne n$$ and $$x_m = x_n$$, then $$m + n = n + m = 0$$
4. if $$m \ne n$$ and $$x_m \ne x_n$$, then $$-(m+n)$$ equals $$-(m + n)$$ and is the 3rd intersection of the curve and the line cross $$m$$ and $$n$$.

From the 3rd and4th cases above, we know the relation between $$m + n$$ and $$m$$, $$n$$ would be like:

It can be proved that such a group is an Abelian group.

#### Scalar multiplication

We can also defin a scalar multiplication based on the plus operation upon the elliptic curve groups:

$$dm = \sum_{i=1}^d m$$

where $$d$$ is a positive integer and $$m$$ is a element in the group.

The above expression could be calculated in time complexity of $$O(logn)$$ by disassembling the $$d$$ into factors that are powers of 2. 

#### The logrithm problem

In last section, we see given $$d$$ and $$m$$, it's easy to get $$dm$$. However, given the $$m$$ and result of $$dm$$, with some cleverly constructed instances it would be very hard to know the value of $$d$$, i.e. the times of operation performed to get the $$dm$$. And this hard problem is called logrithm problem.

#### Field

[Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)) is a set on which addition and multiplication are defined. The two kinds of operations are **closed**, **associative** and **commutative**. Moreover, there are **two identity elements** for both kinds of operations respectively. Finally, there is distributiveness, i.e. $$m(n+r) = mn + mr$$.

#### Finite field on prime

For a prime $$P$$, the set of integers from 0 to $$P-1$$ could be a field. And the addition and multiplication are defined as:

$$(m+n)\mod P$$

$$(mn)\mod p$$

And the behavior or identity elements are:

$$(m + (-m)) \mod P = 0$$

$$(m(m^{-1})) \mod P = 1$$

Absolutely, arithmetic negation is the additional reverse in this field. But the multipilicational reverse is not that easy, actually the [extended Euclidean algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm) tell us this could be done in time complexity of $$O(logP)$$. As an example, 4 and 2 are mutual multipilicational reverse when $$P$$ is 7 since $$4*2 \mod 8 = 1$$.

#### Elliptic curve over finite fields

Previously the elliptic curves consist of points with coordinates of real numbers. But now we restrict the curve upon a finite field which only contains integers betwen 0 and $$p-1$$.

$$y^2 \equiv x^3 + ax + b \mod P$$

When 

$$4a^3 + 27b^2 \not\equiv 0 \mod P$$

Where $$P$$ is a prime number, $$x$$, $$y$$, $$a$$ and $$b$$ are integers, and $$0\le x, y\le P-1$$.

Here is an example graph of $$y^2 \equiv x^3 - 7x + 10 \mod 19$$:

![](http://tao93.top/images/2020/01/05/1578243411.png)

Note that most of the points in the above graph are symmetrical over the line $$y=P/2$$ except the points on line $$y=0$$.

#### Group on the elliptic curve over finite fields

To define a group, firstly we need to define the plus operation on the elliptic curve over finite fields. The plus operation is similar to the operation we defined previously for elliptic curve over real numbers.

The identity element is same as before. The reverse pair of elements are symmectircal over the line $$y = p/2$$.

For any pointers $$m$$ and $$n$$ on the discrete curve and $$x_m \ne x_n$$, $$m+n$$ is the reverse proint of the 3rd intersection between the discrete curve points and the lines denoted by:

$$y \equiv kx + t \mod P$$

when the lines cross $$m$$ and $$n$$, and $$k$$, $$t$$ are constants.

It could be proved with such a addition operation defined, a group is generated on the discrete elliptic curve over a finite field from prime $$P$$.

The number of points in such a group is called the **order** of the group. Similar with previous continuous elliptic curve, we can perform scalar multipilication:

$$dm = \sum_{i=1}^d m$$

where $$d$$ is a positive integer and $$m$$ is a element in the group.

For any $$m$$ in such a group $$G$$, the smallest integer $$d$$ such that $$dm$$ equals the identity element point is called the order of the subgroup which contains $$m$$, $$2m$$, $$3m$$, ..., $$(d-1)m$$ and the identity element point. The subgroup is cyclic. And the number of elements in a subgroup is called **order** of the subgroup.

Let's say the order of the parent group is$$ D$$.According to [Lagrange's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_theorem_(group_theory)), the order of a subgroup is a diviser of $$D$$. 

Hence for any $$m$$ in the parent group, we can check the divisers of $$D$$ one by one to find out the order of subgroup based on $$m$$. On the contrary, for any prime diviser $$d$$ of $$D$$, any element point $$m$$ such that $$(D/d)m$$ not equal the identity element is the base point to form a subgroup. (Hint: $$Dm$$ is always the identity element.)

Given $$m$$ and $$n$$ in such a group G, getting a $$k$$ such that $$km=n$$ is also very harder for some instances, just like the logrithm problem we mentioned previously.

#### Elliptic curve cryptography applications

To leverage elliptic curve group over finite fileds on primes, there are some parameters called domain parameters to determine the concrete instances.

1. $$a$$ and $$b$$, real numbers to determine the $$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$ equation
2. $$p$$, a prime that determine the finite field of 1, 2, 3, ..., $$p-1$$
3. $$G$$, a base point in the discrete elliptic curve to form a cyclic subgroup of $$G$$, $$2G$$, $$3G$$, ..., identity element
4. $$n$$, which is order of the subgroup based on $$G$$, hence $$nG$$ is the identity element
5. $$h$$, called cofactor, which is result of $$n$$ divides the number points of the parent group.

The above $$(p, a, b, G, n, h)$$ consists the domain parameters that determine the concrete instances.

In the Elliptic curve cryptography, The **private key** is a random number $$d$$ such that $$ 1 \le d \le n-1$$. The **public key** is the result of $$dG$$.

##### EC Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm

In EC Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. Alice and Bob have their private keys $$d_A$$ and $$d_B$$. With the public domain parameters, they would compute $$d_A G$$ and $$d_B G$$ and exchange these two values. Finally, they would compute $$d_A d_B G$$ and $$d_B d_A G$$ respectively as the shared secret key. Of course $$d_A d_B G = d_B d_A G$$.

The EC Diffie-Hellman key exchange is based on that given the domain parameters, it's hard to know $$d_A d_B G$$ given $$d_A G$$ and $$d_B G$$, and smae for $$d_A$$ and $$d_B$$.

While the original Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is based on exponential modular. Private keys are random numbers $$d_A$$ and $$d_B$$, public keys are $$k^{d_A} \mod p$$ and $$k^{d_B} \mod p$$, and the shared secret key is $$k^{d_A} \mod p$$.

The shared secret key in EC Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm are coordinates of the point $$d_A d_B G$$, which could be used to perform symmectirc encryption just like TLS does.

Actually in TLS, we often see ECDHE in which the ending E means ephemeral. Actually when TLS uses ECDHE, during the handshake procedure, the public and private keys generated in ECDHE won't be used for encryption. TLS just want both sides to generate a shared private symmectric encryption key, which is really for encryption of application data.

##### EC digital signature algorithm

Alice could use her private key $$d_A$$ to generate a signature for digest of a message. Bob would be able to verify the signature by using public key of Alice, i.e. $$d_A G$$.

#### ECC and RSA

ECC(clliptic curve cryptography) is better than RSA in that key size of ECC is smaller to achieve same security level. Moreover, the security level improved by doubling key size of RSA is less than ECC.
